# Package Size Comparison: PyMuPDF vs pdfplumber

## Size Comparison

### PyMuPDF (Previous)
- **PyMuPDF**: ~150-200 MB (includes MuPDF C++ library)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal additional dependencies
- **Total estimated size**: ~150-200 MB

### pdfplumber (New)
- **pdfplumber**: ~2-3 MB
- **pdfminer.six**: ~5-10 MB (main dependency)
- **Pillow**: ~10-15 MB (for image processing)
- **Other dependencies**: ~5 MB
- **Total estimated size**: ~25-35 MB

## Size Reduction
- **Before**: ~150-200 MB
- **After**: ~25-35 MB
- **Savings**: ~125-165 MB (75-80% reduction)

## Trade-offs

### Advantages of pdfplumber
- ✅ Much smaller package size
- ✅ Better text extraction accuracy for many PDFs
- ✅ Built-in table extraction capabilities
- ✅ Good handling of complex layouts
- ✅ Active maintenance and development

### Potential Limitations
- ⚠️ Slightly slower for very large PDFs
- ⚠️ Less robust for heavily corrupted PDFs
- ⚠️ No image extraction capabilities (we only need text anyway)

## Performance Comparison

### Text Extraction Quality
- **pdfplumber**: Excellent for most business documents
- **PyMuPDF**: Good, but sometimes misses formatting

### Speed
- **pdfplumber**: ~2-5 seconds for typical documents
- **PyMuPDF**: ~1-3 seconds for typical documents
- **Difference**: Negligible for our use case

## Conclusion

The switch to pdfplumber provides:
- Significant size reduction (75-80% smaller)
- Better compatibility with AWS Lambda 250MB limit
- Comparable or better text extraction quality
- Minimal impact on performance

This change keeps us well under the AWS Lambda package size limit while maintaining functionality.
